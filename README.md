Sure! Here's concise and clear information about *Interpreter* and *Open Source License*, explained separately:

---

*Interpreter*
An *Interpreter* is a type of program that reads and executes code *line by line*. It does not convert the whole program into machine code at once like a compiler does. Instead, it translates and runs each line immediately.

*Key Features:*
- Executes code line-by-line.
- Easier to debug and test small pieces of code.
- Slower than compilers because translation happens during runtime.

*Examples of Interpreted Languages:*
- Python
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Ruby

*Use:* Great for scripting, quick testing, and learning programming.

---

*Open Source License*
An *Open Source License* is a legal agreement that lets users:
- *Use*, *modify*, and *share* software freely.
- Access the *source code*.

*Main Types:*
1. *Permissive Licenses* (e.g., MIT, Apache):
   - Allow reuse with minimal restrictions.
   - You can even use them in closed-source projects.

2. *Copyleft Licenses* (e.g., GNU GPL):
   - If you modify and share the code, you must also release your changes as open source.

*Purpose:*
- Encourages collaboration.
- Ensures transparency and freedom in software development. # homework
